        <p>My name is Linh. I’m a human-centered advocate. I’m fascinated by listening to people’s stories and understanding their interactions with the world.</p>
        <p>I have a bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Recently, I graduated from the University of Washington's Master’s program in Human-Centered Design and Engineering. As I work on my crafts, I strive to practice and hone technical skills that enable me to learn and reimagine our relationships with our environments, both digital and physical.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy drawing 🖍️, watching movies 🎥, reading some good books 📚️, or just chilling with my dog, Ramen 🐶.</p>
        <p>You can find me on LinkedIn or contact me via my email.</p>
