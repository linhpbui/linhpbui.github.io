                <p>Iâ€™m a design researcher and advocate.</p>
                <p>
                    I do research to create inclusive and accessible design. As I
                    work on my crafts, I strive to practice and hone technical
                    skills that enable me to learn and reimagine our relationships
                    with our environments, both digital and physical.
