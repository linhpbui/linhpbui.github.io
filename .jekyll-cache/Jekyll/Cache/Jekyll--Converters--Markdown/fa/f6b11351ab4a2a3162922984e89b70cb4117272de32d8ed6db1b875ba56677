I"ù*<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: January ‚Äì June 2022</p>

<p><strong>Role</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lead Mixed-Method UX Researcher: deciding on research methods, crafting research plan and script, conducting interviews, and analyzing data.</li>
  <li>Project Coordinator: primary communicator with the sponsors, organizing testing schedules with participants.
Assistant UX Designer: ideating design concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a capstone project for my Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) Master‚Äôs degree at the University of Washington, working with our sponsor - Nourishing Networks Consortium. I collaborated with 3 other UX Designers.</p>

<p>Nourishing Networks Consortium (NNC) is a non-profit organization that builds a network between passionate volunteers and organizations to create sustainable solutions to help individuals and families who are facing food insecurity to find local and regional food resources.</p>

        <h2>Problem space</h2>
        <p>Our initial challenge started with the vague and broad problem space that our sponsors proposed for the capstone project: They wanted us to develop a digital foundation of a human-to-human network that amplify the efficiencies and impact of each individual node in the network, and the entire network.</p>
        <p>Through two rounds of stakeholder interviews with the two sponsors and their two researchers, I identified a specific problem and narrowed down our research objective: Different volunteers use different methods of communication to share and collaborate; hence, the stream of information scatters. <strong>Our sponsors want to integrate the scattered information stream into one place for ease of retrieval and share across the networks.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Design question</h2>
        <p>How might we facilitate the communication and collaboration between the volunteers at the Nourishing Network community?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our design solution is a combination of a website repository of resources and an internal tool. The website acts as a reference point for volunteers where the volunteers can get access, retrieve, and share resources they need across networks. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Impacts</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our sponsors took our suggestion to create a guideline after reading our first report.</li>
                <li>Working on a solution that even people with low technical literacy skills can use easily.</li>
            </ul>

  <p>‚ÄúWe would like to figure out the best way to communicate within Nourishing Networks and get engage in what‚Äôs happening, and broadcast out what‚Äôs going on with each other.‚Äù ‚Äî Stakeholder 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="project-goals">Project goals</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Create an easy-to-navigate platform that allows people with low technical literacy to be able to use it.</li>
  <li>Identify ways to simplify the process of finding people and resources for volunteer events.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-questions">Research questions</h1>

<p>To find the answer to our design question, we identified two research questions for the first phase of the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of communication/collaboration resources volunteers at the Nourishing Networks need?</li>
  <li>When do people need the resources to communicate?</li>
  <li>What makes a platform easy to navigate?</li>
  <li>What kind of methods have the volunteers used to address their needs for communication and collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-plan">Research plan</h1>

<p>This project divided into two phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first three months, our team focused on doing generative research to identify problems and opportunities.</li>
  <li>The last three months, we focused on ideation and evaluative research to design the best possible solution that our sponsor can adopt for their organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 2-1 below outlined the research process I used for this project.</p>

<h1 id="generative-research--how-we-ground-ourselves-with-research">Generative Research ‚Äî How we ground ourselves with research</h1>

<p>I carefully went through each research method to understand what type of information we needed to collect to learn about the volunteers‚Äô current process, pain points, and needs. When choosing the methods, I made sure that the data I collected from one method could inform and be built upon one another. For example, I could use the survey respondents‚Äô list of tools listed to work on the competitive analysis.</p>

<h2 id="research-methodologies">Research methodologies</h2>

<div class="grid4x4 methodologies">
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>4</h1>
        <h2>stakeholder interviews</h2>
        <p>We had two rounds of stakeholder interviews with 4 stakeholders. The stakeholders were our two main sponsors, and two researchers. Insights we learned from the interview helped us narrow down the problem space of the project. <strong>We were able to develop our design requirements after analyzing our stakeholders‚Äô answers to our questions.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>29</h1>
        <h2>survey responses</h2>
        <p>We distributed the survey to our network circle and collected 29 valid responses. The survey results revealed what methods they used to communicate with other volunteers and manage projects, and whether they considered those methods challenging to use or effective to use. <strong>The results also informed our competitive analysis, as we were able to collect the most common products used by other volunteers.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>6</h1>
        <h2>one-on-one interviews</h2>
        <p>We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 6 NNC volunteers, ranging from new volunteers to experienced volunteers at NNC. <strong>Insights from these interviews informed us on our target audience and important design decisions.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>17</h1>
        <h2>competitive products analyses</h2>
        <p>We conducted a competitive analysis with 17 existing products that were mentioned in the survey and one-on-one interviews. <strong>Our competitive analysis helped us observe the features, strengths and weaknesses of the products that the volunteers are currently using, why are some products more challenging or easier to use than other products.</strong></p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key findings</h2>

<p><strong>Finding 1: Email is both an effective and ineffective form of communication.</strong></p>

<p>While the volunteers used different methods such as email, text messages, and phone calls, they thought that email is the best way to reach out to them on the go. However, they also thought that mail is challenging to use because the emails get buried in their inbox easily. Unless they check the email and reply right away, they will forget to get back or spend more time looking for the email.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI wish there is a centralized place to have all the information. Because it‚Äôs easy for me to lose track of all emails, I want a central repository of the date when an event happens.‚Äù ‚Äî Participant 6</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Finding 2: Navigating and using the current system such as Google Drive can be complicated for some volunteers.</strong></p>

<p>Navigating the Nourishing Networks‚Äô Google Drive can be complex and overwhelming because it holds a lot of documents over the years. Newcomers have issues knowing where to start, and it takes time to find documents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWe are using Google Drive to hold all the documents, but a lot of people can‚Äôt use it, so we need a tool that is more accessible and easier to use.‚Äù ‚Äî Participant 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Finding 3: Most existing tools have a steep learning curve.</strong></p>

<p>In our competitive analysis, we found that most project management tools assumed that the users have some basic knowledge on how to use the different features (Kanban, Gantt chart, or Grid view, etc.). Most of the current products offer simple interface; however, they have too many features and options to use the product that overwhelm users with low digital literacy.</p>

<p>From the weaknesses I found in the competitive analysis method, I also found two opportunities for us to explore moving forward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can work with our target audience through a co-design sessions to learn what type of feature they are familiar with and apply those to our solutions.</li>
  <li>We can learn what makes a good documentation or guideline to help explain the functionality and terminologies of a feature or a workflow for our target audience.</li>
</ul>
