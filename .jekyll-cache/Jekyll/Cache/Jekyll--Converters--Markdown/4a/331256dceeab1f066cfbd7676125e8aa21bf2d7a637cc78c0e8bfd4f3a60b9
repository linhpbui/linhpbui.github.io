I"˙<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: January ‚Äì June 2022</p>

<p><strong>Role</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lead Mixed-Method UX Researcher: deciding on research methods, crafting research plan and script, conducting interviews, and analyzing data.</li>
  <li>Project Coordinator: primary communicator with the sponsors, organizing testing schedules with participants.
Assistant UX Designer: ideating design concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a capstone project for my Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) Master‚Äôs degree at the University of Washington, working with our sponsor - Nourishing Networks Consortium. I collaborated with 3 other UX Designers.</p>

<p>Nourishing Networks Consortium (NNC) is a non-profit organization that builds a network between passionate volunteers and organizations to create sustainable solutions to help individuals and families who are facing food insecurity to find local and regional food resources.</p>

        <h2>Problem space</h2>
        <p>Our initial challenge started with the vague and broad problem space that our sponsors proposed for the capstone project: They wanted us to develop a digital foundation of a human-to-human network that amplify the efficiencies and impact of each individual node in the network, and the entire network.</p>
        <p>Through two rounds of stakeholder interviews with the two sponsors and their two researchers, I identified a specific problem and narrowed down our research objective: Different volunteers use different methods of communication to share and collaborate; hence, the stream of information scatters. <strong>Our sponsors want to integrate the scattered information stream into one place for ease of retrieval and share across the networks.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Design question</h2>
        <p>How might we facilitate the communication and collaboration between the volunteers at the Nourishing Network community?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our design solution is a combination of a website repository of resources and an internal tool. The website acts as a reference point for volunteers where the volunteers can get access, retrieve, and share resources they need across networks. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="quarter">
        <h2>Impacts</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our sponsors took our suggestion to create a guideline after reading our first report.</li>
                <li>Working on a solution that even people with low technical literacy skills can use easily.</li>
            </ul>

  <p>‚ÄúWe would like to figure out the best way to communicate within Nourishing Networks and get engage in what‚Äôs happening, and broadcast out what‚Äôs going on with each other.‚Äù ‚Äî Stakeholder 1</p>

<h1 id="project-goals">Project goals</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Create an easy-to-navigate platform that allows people with low technical literacy to be able to use it.</li>
  <li>Identify ways to simplify the process of finding people and resources for volunteer events.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-questions">Research questions</h1>

<p>To find the answer to our design question, we identified two research questions for the first phase of the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of communication/collaboration resources volunteers at the Nourishing Networks need?</li>
  <li>When do people need the resources to communicate?</li>
  <li>What makes a platform easy to navigate?</li>
  <li>What kind of methods have the volunteers used to address their needs for communication and collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-plan">Research plan</h1>

<p>This project divided into two phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first three months, our team focused on doing generative research to identify problems and opportunities.</li>
  <li>The last three months, we focused on ideation and evaluative research to design the best possible solution that our sponsor can adopt for their organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 2-1 below outlined the research process I used for this project.</p>

<p>To address the research questions, I identified the type of data that I needed to collect and the goals for each research method (figure 2-2).</p>
