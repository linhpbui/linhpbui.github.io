</blockquote>

<h1 id="project-goals">Project goals</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Create an easy-to-navigate platform that allows people with low technical literacy to be able to use it.</li>
  <li>Identify ways to simplify the process of finding people and resources for volunteer events.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-questions">Research questions</h1>

<p>To find the answer to our design question, we identified two research questions for the first phase of the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What kind of communication/collaboration resources volunteers at the Nourishing Networks need?</li>
  <li>When do people need the resources to communicate?</li>
  <li>What makes a platform easy to navigate?</li>
  <li>What kind of methods have the volunteers used to address their needs for communication and collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="research-plan">Research plan</h1>

<p>This project divided into two phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first three months, our team focused on doing generative research to identify problems and opportunities.</li>
  <li>The last three months, we focused on ideation and evaluative research to design the best possible solution that our sponsor can adopt for their organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 2-1 below outlined the research process I used for this project.</p>

<h1 id="generative-research--how-we-ground-ourselves-with-research">Generative Research ‚Äî How we ground ourselves with research</h1>

<p>I carefully went through each research method to understand what type of information we needed to collect to learn about the volunteers‚Äô current process, pain points, and needs. When choosing the methods, I made sure that the data I collected from one method could inform and be built upon one another. For example, I could use the survey respondents‚Äô list of tools listed to work on the competitive analysis.</p>

<h2 id="research-methodologies">Research methodologies</h2>

<div class="grid4x4 methodologies">
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>4</h1>
        <h2>stakeholder interviews</h2>
        <p>We had two rounds of stakeholder interviews with 4 stakeholders. The stakeholders were our two main sponsors, and two researchers. Insights we learned from the interview helped us narrow down the problem space of the project. <strong>We were able to develop our design requirements after analyzing our stakeholders‚Äô answers to our questions.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>29</h1>
        <h2>survey responses</h2>
        <p>We distributed the survey to our network circle and collected 29 valid responses. The survey results revealed what methods they used to communicate with other volunteers and manage projects, and whether they considered those methods challenging to use or effective to use. <strong>The results also informed our competitive analysis, as we were able to collect the most common products used by other volunteers.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>6</h1>
        <h2>one-on-one interviews</h2>
        <p>We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 6 NNC volunteers, ranging from new volunteers to experienced volunteers at NNC. <strong>Insights from these interviews informed us on our target audience and important design decisions.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater">
        <h1>17</h1>
        <h2>competitive products analyses</h2>
        <p>We conducted a competitive analysis with 17 existing products that were mentioned in the survey and one-on-one interviews. <strong>Our competitive analysis helped us observe the features, strengths and weaknesses of the products that the volunteers are currently using, why are some products more challenging or easier to use than other products.</strong></p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key findings</h2>

<p><strong>Finding 1: Email is both an effective and ineffective form of communication.</strong></p>

<p>While the volunteers used different methods such as email, text messages, and phone calls, they thought that email is the best way to reach out to them on the go. However, they also thought that mail is challenging to use because the emails get buried in their inbox easily. Unless they check the email and reply right away, they will forget to get back or spend more time looking for the email.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI wish there is a centralized place to have all the information. Because it‚Äôs easy for me to lose track of all emails, I want a central repository of the date when an event happens.‚Äù ‚Äî Participant 6</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Finding 2: Navigating and using the current system such as Google Drive can be complicated for some volunteers.</strong></p>

<p>Navigating the Nourishing Networks‚Äô Google Drive can be complex and overwhelming because it holds a lot of documents over the years. Newcomers have issues knowing where to start, and it takes time to find documents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWe are using Google Drive to hold all the documents, but a lot of people can‚Äôt use it, so we need a tool that is more accessible and easier to use.‚Äù ‚Äî Participant 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Finding 3: Most existing tools have a steep learning curve.</strong></p>

<p>In our competitive analysis, we found that most project management tools assumed that the users have some basic knowledge on how to use the different features (Kanban, Gantt chart, or Grid view, etc.). Most of the current products offer simple interface; however, they have too many features and options to use the product that overwhelm users with low digital literacy.</p>

<p>From the weaknesses I found in the competitive analysis method, I also found two opportunities for us to explore moving forward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can work with our target audience through a co-design sessions to learn what type of feature they are familiar with and apply those to our solutions.</li>
  <li>We can learn what makes a good documentation or guideline to help explain the functionality and terminologies of a feature or a workflow for our target audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-journey">User journey</h2>

<p>I also created a user journey for our target audience. From this user journey, I found that our users experienced the pain points from stage 3 - 6 (the red rectangle box) of the journey, particularly where they wanted to reach out to other volunteers for help or finding resources from their colleagues. With that, we had a clearer understanding of the particular touchpoint that we could work on for the design solution for the problem.</p>

<h1 id="design-process">Design process</h1>

<p>As a team, we brainstormed different design solutions that could help us address the volunteers‚Äô pain points and needs. We gathered feedback from our peers, professors, and stakeholders to iterate upon the potential solutions (figure 8).</p>

<p>We conducted co-working sessions with 5 participants to understand which solutions would be more beneficial to address their problems where they rated their top 3 choices in terms of helpfulness, feasibility, viability, and desirability (figure 9).</p>

<p>After narrowing down our design solution, we sketched and created an information architecture and wireframes for the solution. We had two meetings with our main sponsors and their members to go through the wireframes to gather feedback from them. We learned which features to add or to remove and prioritize the design of the more important features according to their feedback.</p>

<p>While our designers were finishing designing the mid-fidelity prototype, I wrote the usability script to prepare for our usability test.</p>

<h1 id="evaluative-research--evaluating-our-potential-design-solutions">Evaluative Research ‚Äî Evaluating our potential design solutions</h1>

<p>After we had our mid-fidelity prototype, we conducted a usability test with 7 participants to evaluate our design and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

<h2 id="participant-profile">Participant profile</h2>
<ul>
  <li>7 participants are NN volunteers</li>
  <li>6 of the participants have low- to mid-technical literacy skill.</li>
  <li>1 participant has high technical literacy skill.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identify weaknesses and strength of the general UI navigation and structure of the prototype</li>
  <li>Identify obstacles users encounter when navigating the prototype</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-questions-1">Research questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How easy was it for the low tech literacy users to navigate the prototype?</li>
  <li>Is the website effective for volunteers to find necessary information?</li>
  <li>What are the obstacles that stop users from completing a task?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-findings-1">Key findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>6 out of 7 participants found some initial designs of the headings and locations of important information were either too small or hidden from other designs.</li>
  <li>5 out of 7 participants found the wording and terminologies that we used were difficult to understand.</li>
  <li>7 out of 7 participants found some button positions, page design and layout were inconsistent with each other.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="our-solution">Our solution</h1>

<p>Our final solution is a redesigned website with several added features such as Network Resource, Events, Dashboard, Directory and Blog to help users easily manage their day-to-day tasks and communication in the organization. It is a combination of a website repository of resources and an internal tool. The website acts as a reference point for volunteers where the volunteers can get access, retrieve, and share resources they need across networks.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-decided-on-this-solution">Why we decided on this solution</h2>

<p>After our co-working sessions with participants, we learned that participants preferred the guideline and the directory ideas. When presented the findings to our stakeholders to discuss the next step, our stakeholders told us they were preparing to work on guidelines with their internal team and wanted us to focus our attention on working on a directory.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a new internal tool for the volunteers, we decided to redesign the website, because most of the volunteers that we interviewed <strong>were already familiar with using the website</strong>.</p>

<p>Based on our interaction with the volunteers, we had a presumption that it would be easier for them to adopt a new feature in an existing tool. With the current number of products on the market, the volunteers will have to learn how to use them from scratch if the organization decides to adopt it and must create different accounts on various platforms in order to use them. However, with this solution, users only need to create one account; thus, reducing the burden of learning new technology and their hesitation to adopt new technologies.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Had more practice in narrowing big scope.</strong> Working with a broad and vague initial scope like this project, I gained more experience to narrow down the scope. As the lead researcher on the team, I led the research to narrow down the research. Digging through all the past research and asking questions helped me understand the organization deeper; thus, allowing me to ask better questions that could help us pivot to the right direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> When working in a team, a lot of things can happen that did not go the way we want. However, I learned to be more flexible and adapt to changes to accommodate with my teammates‚Äô difficulties.</li>
</ul>
